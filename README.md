# TinySquad

# Setup
Before setup the engine with premake :
- Install Vulkan SDK with the minimum 1.3 runtime version
- Install Visual Studio 2022

With everything installed you can launch Setup-Windows.bat on windows or ./Setup-Windows.sh on linux

In the first launch of Visual Studio 2022, you need to change value for "Use Library Dependency Inputs" from "No" to "Yes" under TinyEngine>Properties>Linker>General>Use Library Dependency Inputs.
